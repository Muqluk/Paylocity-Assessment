# Objective <br>&ensp;<sup><sup><sub>_[Return to index](/docs/docs-index.md)_<sub></sup></sup>

### This coding challenge is designed to allow you to 
  1. Demonstrate your abilities
  1. Discuss your approach to design and implementation with your potential colleagues.

## _Please be prepared to discuss the choices you’ve made_

### Motivation:
  > Each of our Paylocity product teams operates like a small startup, empowered to deliver business value in whatever way they see fit.  Because our teams are close knit and fast moving it is imperative that you are able to work collaboratively with your fellow developers.
  >
  > The most important part of this challenge is to use your work as a jumping off point for a broad and deep conversation with our developers.  Please take this as an opportunity to demonstrate the best of your abilities feel free to mock out or skip pieces of the implementation and focus your time on exactly what you would like to show us.  
  >  
  > You are not expected to spend more than a few hours on this project and are free to use whatever technologies you prefer.  

#### This is of course a contrived example.  We want to know how **_you_** approach
  * Designing the API
  * Designing the Backing Data Store
  * Implementing the Class Structure & Calculations
  
#### Proceed with the assessment when ready with the following in mind:
  1. We are expecting candidates to typically spend about 2-3 hours on this exercise
  1. We realize that this **_may_** lead to an incomplete implementation.  
  1. **_We’re not looking for you to give up your weekend_** for this project, we want something to start a meaningful conversation
