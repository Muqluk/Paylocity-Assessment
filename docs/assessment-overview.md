## Objective

This coding challenge is designed to allow you to 
  1. demonstrate your abilities
  1. discuss your approach to design and implementation with your potential colleagues. 

  The most important part of this challenge is to use your work as a jumping off point for a broad and deep conversation with our developers.  Please take this as an opportunity to demonstrate the best of your abilities feel free to mock out or skip pieces of the implementation and focus your time on exactly what <u>**_you_**</u> would like to show <u>**_us_**</u>.  
  
  You are not expected to spend more than a few hours on this project and are free to use whatever technologies you prefer.  

<u>**_Please be prepared to discuss the choices you’ve made_**</u>.


### This is of course a contrived example.  We want to know how <u>**_you_**</u> would:
  1. Design the API
  1. Design the Backing Data Store
  1. Implement the Class Structure & Calculations

  
#### Proceed with the assessment when ready <u>**_with the following in mind_**</u>:
  1. We are expecting candidates to typically spend about <u>2-3 hours</u> on this exercise
  1. We realize that this **_may_** lead to an incomplete implementation.  
  1. <u>**_We’re not looking for you to give up your weekend_**</u> for this project, we want something to start a meaningful conversation
